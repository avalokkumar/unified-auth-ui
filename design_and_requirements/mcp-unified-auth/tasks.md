# Capability: Unified Authentication for MCP Servers

## Context
The Unified Authentication UI currently provides authentication services for user login, session management, and API key management. MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers require a centralized authentication mechanism that complies with OAuth 2.1 standards to provide secure access across the ecosystem of AI models, tools, and services. This feature will extend the existing authentication system to support MCP servers with emphasis on security, scalability, and interoperability.

## Rationale
MCP servers require a standardized approach to authentication and authorization to ensure secure access control while maintaining high performance and scalability. By implementing a centralized authentication system that leverages OAuth 2.1, we can provide:
- A single point of authentication across all MCP servers in the ecosystem
- Improved security through mandatory PKCE and other OAuth 2.1 enhancements
- Simplified integration for new MCP servers and clients
- Support for diverse authentication flows tailored to different entity types (human users, machine-to-machine services, AI agents)
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring capabilities

## Functional Objectives

### Critical / Required
- Implement OAuth 2.1 compliant authorization server for MCP ecosystem
- Support Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for human users
- Support Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine authentication
- Support Dynamic Client Registration for AI agents and tools
- Implement token validation endpoints for resource servers
- Create admin interface for managing MCP server registrations
- Implement token revocation capabilities
- Support refresh token rotation
- Implement introspection endpoints for token validation
- Build API gateway integration for centralized policy enforcement
- Create developer documentation for MCP server integration

### Optional / Nice to Have
- Implement mTLS (mutual TLS) for high-security machine-to-machine authentication
- Support DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession) for token security
- Add AI/ML-based risk assessment for authentication requests
- Implement token exchange for delegation scenarios
- Create monitoring dashboard for authentication metrics
- Support for FIDO2/WebAuthn for passwordless authentication
- Implement infrastructure-asserted identity for cloud-native environments
- Add support for fine-grained permissions at the model/tool level
- Support for customizable scopes based on MCP server requirements
- Implement JWT token signing with rotating keys

## Non-Functional Objectives
- Performance & scalability: 
  - Support for 1000+ requests/second
  - 99.99% uptime SLA (to be confirmed)
  - < 100ms response time for token validation
- Reliability / SLOs:
  - Graceful degradation during peak loads
  - Horizontal scalability for authorization server components
  - Auto-recovery mechanisms for system failures
- Authorization & compliance integration:
  - Compliance with GDPR, SOC2, and other relevant standards
  - Support for audit logging of all authentication events
  - Regular security review processes
- Quality gates:
  - Comprehensive unit and integration testing
  - Security penetration testing
  - Load testing for performance validation
- Observability:
  - Detailed logging of authentication events
  - Prometheus metrics for system performance
  - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Documentation deliverables:
  - Developer integration guides
  - Security best practices documentation
  - Operational runbooks

## Technical Insights
- The system should be designed as stateless microservices for horizontal scalability
- Token storage should use a distributed cache (Redis) for performance
- Consider using existing OAuth 2.1 frameworks like Spring Authorization Server, Keycloak, or Auth0
- Implement proper key management for JWT signing
- Use container orchestration (Kubernetes) for deployment and scaling
- Ensure proper rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation

## UI & Design Resources
- Admin interface for MCP server registration and management
- Developer portal for API documentation and testing
- Consent screens for user authorization
- Token management interface for administrators
- Custom error pages for authentication failures

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Performance bottlenecks during peak load | Implement horizontal scaling and caching strategies |
| Security vulnerabilities in implementation | Regular security audits and penetration testing |
| Integration complexity for MCP servers | Comprehensive documentation and SDK development |
| Token leakage or theft | Implement short token lifetimes and token binding |
| System downtime affecting all MCP servers | Deploy across multiple availability zones with failover |
| Compliance with evolving standards | Regular reviews of OAuth and security standards |

## Prerequisites
- Existing Unified Authentication UI infrastructure
- Database system for identity and client storage
- Caching layer for token management
- API Gateway for request routing and policy enforcement
- Infrastructure for horizontal scaling and high availability
- PKI infrastructure for certificate management (for mTLS)

## Success Criteria
- All OAuth 2.1 flows are successfully implemented and tested
- System can handle the required load with specified performance metrics
- MCP servers can successfully integrate with the authentication system
- Security testing passes without critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation is complete and verified by external developers
- Admin interfaces allow for effective management of clients and tokens
- Logging and monitoring provide sufficient visibility into system operation

## Out of Scope
- Support for legacy OAuth 2.0 flows that have been deprecated in OAuth 2.1
- Direct LDAP/Active Directory integration (will be handled separately)
- On-premise deployment options (cloud-first approach)
- Support for social login providers (to be addressed in future releases)
- Custom branding for individual MCP servers' authentication screens

## Unresolved Issues
- What is the expected peak load for authentication requests?
- Are there specific compliance requirements beyond standard security practices?
- What is the required token lifetime for different entity types?
- Should we support federated identity providers like SAML?
- What metrics are most important for monitoring system health?
- Should we prioritize building SDKs for specific programming languages?
