# Ideation — Unified Authentication for MCP Servers

## Cycle 1 — 2025-05-30

### Decisions to Take

1. **OAuth 2.1 as the Foundation**
   - Adopt OAuth 2.1 as the core protocol for all authentication flows
   - Require PKCE for all authorization code flows
   - Deprecate any legacy authentication methods

2. **Entity-Specific Authentication Flows**
   - Human Users: Authorization Code Flow with PKCE + OpenID Connect
   - Machine-to-Machine: Client Credentials Grant with optional mTLS
   - AI Agents/Tools: Dynamic Client Registration with OAuth Token Exchange

3. **Architectural Approach**
   - Microservices-based architecture for horizontal scalability
   - API Gateway as central policy enforcement point
   - Stateless design with distributed caching for tokens
   - Container orchestration (Kubernetes) for deployment

4. **Technology Stack Considerations**
   - Backend: Node.js with Express (to align with existing auth system) or Spring Boot
   - Token Format: JWT with RS256 signing
   - Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for identity storage
   - Caching: Redis for token storage and session management
   - API Gateway: Kong, Nginx, or AWS API Gateway

5. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement token binding with DPoP when possible
   - Short-lived access tokens (5-15 minutes)
   - Refresh token rotation for enhanced security
   - Rate limiting and anomaly detection

### Reasoning / Trade-offs

1. **OAuth 2.1 vs Custom Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.1 provides standardized, well-tested protocols
   - Industry adoption means better tooling and developer familiarity
   - Trade-off: Some complexity in implementation vs. security benefits

2. **Microservices vs Monolithic**
   - Microservices enable independent scaling of components
   - Better fault isolation and resilience
   - Trade-off: Increased operational complexity vs. scalability benefits

3. **JWT vs Opaque Tokens**
   - JWT allows for stateless validation by resource servers
   - Contains embedded claims about the entity and permissions
   - Trade-off: Larger token size vs. reduced database lookups

4. **Build vs Buy**
   - Consider leveraging existing frameworks (Keycloak, Auth0, etc.)
   - Trade-off: Control and customization vs. development time and maintenance

5. **Token Lifetimes**
   - Short-lived access tokens improve security but require more frequent refreshes
   - Longer token lifetimes improve performance but increase risk if compromised
   - Compromise: Short access tokens with longer refresh tokens that rotate

### Alternatives Explored

1. **Authentication Approaches**
   - Custom token-based authentication: Rejected due to lack of standardization
   - SAML-based federation: Too heavyweight for API-focused MCP ecosystem
   - Basic authentication: Insufficient security for sensitive AI model access

2. **Architectural Patterns**
   - Monolithic auth server: Would limit scalability for high-volume MCP ecosystem
   - Fully decentralized auth: Would complicate policy enforcement and monitoring
   - Hybrid approach: Centralized policy with distributed enforcement is viable but complex

3. **Technology Choices**
   - PASETO tokens instead of JWT: More secure but less adoption in ecosystem
   - Redis as primary database: Great performance but less suitable for complex identity data
   - GraphQL API: Benefits for complex queries but adds complexity for simple auth flows

4. **Identity Management**
   - Delegating to external IdPs only: Would limit control over identity lifecycle
   - Building custom user management: Reinventing the wheel for solved problems
   - Hybrid approach: Own core identity with federation options is most flexible

5. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Multi-region active-active: Most resilient but complex to implement
   - Active-passive failover: Simpler but introduces potential downtime
   - Regional deployments: Good compromise for initial implementation

### Open Issues

1. **Integration Complexity**
   - How much effort will MCP server owners need to integrate with our auth system?
   - Can we provide SDKs or libraries to simplify integration?
   - What documentation and examples will be most helpful?

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - What is the expected peak load for authentication requests?
   - What is the acceptable latency for token validation?
   - How will the system scale during AI model usage spikes?

3. **Security Considerations**
   - What level of token security is appropriate for different types of MCP resources?
   - How should we handle key rotation for JWT signing?
   - What monitoring and alerting are needed for security incidents?

4. **User Experience**
   - How do we balance security with user convenience?
   - What authentication factors are appropriate for different risk levels?
   - How should consent screens work for AI agent delegated access?

5. **Compliance Requirements**
   - What specific regulations apply to our MCP authentication system?
   - How do we handle international data sovereignty issues?
   - What audit logging is required for compliance?

6. **Implementation Phasing**
   - Should we implement all entity types at once or phase the approach?
   - Which security enhancements should be prioritized for the first release?
   - How do we support migration from existing authentication methods?
