# Capability: Client Credentials Grant for Machine-to-Machine Authentication

## Context
The Unified Authentication UI currently provides authentication services for user login, session management, and API key management using Next.js. To support the MCP ecosystem, we need to implement the OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials Grant flow to enable secure machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. This grant type is specifically designed for scenarios where a service, application, or AI agent needs to access resources on its own behalf rather than on behalf of a user.

## Rationale
Machine-to-machine communication is a critical component of the MCP ecosystem, where backend services, AI agents, and tools need to interact with MCP servers without human intervention. Implementing the Client Credentials Grant provides several benefits:
- Enables secure, automated authentication between services and MCP servers
- Provides a standardized OAuth 2.1 compliant approach to M2M authentication
- Supports fine-grained access control through scopes
- Eliminates the need for sharing long-lived credentials between services
- Enables centralized management and monitoring of service-to-service interactions
- Allows for immediate revocation of access when needed

## Functional Objectives

- Support granular scope definition and validation for machine clients
- Create token issuance with configurable short lifetimes (5-60 minutes)

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|

| Token theft or interception | Use short-lived tokens, enforce TLS, and implement token binding where possible |
| Excessive scope granting | Enforce principle of least privilege and provide clear scope management tools |
| Performance bottlenecks | Optimize token validation with caching and efficient crypto implementations |
| Integration complexity | Create clear documentation and SDK libraries for common languages |
| Rate limiting bypass | Implement IP-based and client-based rate limiting with proper monitoring |

## Out of Scope
- Support for interactive flows (Authorization Code, Implicit)
- End-user authentication interfaces
- Social login integration
- Password management features
- SAML or other non-OAuth authentication methods

## Unresolved Issues
- What is the expected ratio of token issuance to validation requests?
- Should we prioritize JWT or opaque tokens for the initial implementation?
- What specific scopes will be required for MCP server interactions?
- How will we handle client authentication for high-security MCP resources?
- What are the specific logging requirements for compliance purposes?
