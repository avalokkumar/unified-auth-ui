# Ideation — Client Credentials Grant for Machine-to-Machine Authentication

## Cycle 1 — 2025-05-30

### Decisions to Take

1. **Token Format Selection**
   - Decision: Use JWT as the primary token format with opaque tokens as an option for high-security scenarios
   - JWT offers self-contained validation which reduces load on the authentication server
   - Opaque tokens provide enhanced security through centralized validation and easier revocation
   - Implementation will support both with configuration options

2. **Client Authentication Methods**
   - Decision: Implement multiple authentication methods with a priority on security
   - Support client_secret_basic as the default method for compatibility
   - Implement client_secret_post for clients that cannot use HTTP headers
   - Add private_key_jwt for high-security scenarios
   - Plan for mTLS as a stretch goal for enhanced security

3. **Token Lifecycle Management**
   - Decision: Focus on short-lived tokens with efficient reacquisition
   - Set default token lifetime to 15 minutes
   - Make token lifetime configurable (5-60 minutes range)
   - No refresh tokens for Client Credentials Grant
   - Implement efficient token reacquisition and caching patterns

4. **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**
   - Decision: Leverage the existing Next.js authentication framework
   - Extend the current API key management system for machine client management
   - Reuse existing database schema where possible with extensions for OAuth-specific fields
   - Maintain consistent coding patterns and documentation style (JSDoc) across new components

5. **Scope Management Approach**
   - Decision: Implement a flexible, granular scope system
   - Support hierarchical scopes (e.g., model:* includes model:read and model:write)
   - Allow for scope grouping and composition
   - Create a scope registry with clear documentation
   - Implement scope-based access control at both token issuance and resource access

### Reasoning / Trade-offs

1. **JWT vs. Opaque Tokens**
   - **Reasoning**: JWTs provide performance benefits by enabling stateless validation
   - **Trade-offs**: JWTs are larger and cannot be easily revoked without additional mechanisms
   - **Decision factor**: The performance gain of JWTs is valuable for high-volume M2M scenarios, but we'll support both for flexibility

2. **Client Secret Storage**
   - **Reasoning**: Secure storage of client secrets is critical to prevent credential leakage
   - **Trade-offs**: Strong hashing algorithms (BCrypt, PBKDF2) increase CPU usage during authentication
   - **Decision factor**: Security is paramount for credentials, so we'll use strong hashing despite the performance impact

3. **Token Lifetime Configuration**
   - **Reasoning**: Shorter token lifetimes enhance security but increase token request frequency
   - **Trade-offs**: Security vs. performance and resource utilization
   - **Decision factor**: Default to 15 minutes as a balanced approach, but allow configuration based on security requirements

4. **Rate Limiting Strategy**
   - **Reasoning**: Rate limiting is essential to prevent brute force attacks and abuse
   - **Trade-offs**: Stricter limits enhance security but may impact legitimate high-volume clients
   - **Decision factor**: Implement a tiered approach with different limits based on client classification and historical usage patterns

5. **Implementation in Next.js**
   - **Reasoning**: Integrating with the existing Next.js infrastructure maintains consistency
   - **Trade-offs**: Some OAuth patterns may not align perfectly with Next.js API routes
   - **Decision factor**: The benefits of consistency and leveraging existing code outweigh the challenges of adaptation

### Alternatives Explored

1. **Authentication Approaches**
   - **Custom API key system**: Simpler but less standardized and lacks the security features of OAuth
   - **SAML-based authentication**: Too heavyweight for M2M scenarios and not well-suited for API access
   - **Mutual TLS only**: Strong security but complex implementation and certificate management
   - **Selected approach**: OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials Grant with multiple authentication methods provides the best balance of security, standardization, and flexibility

2. **Token Storage and Validation**
   - **Database-only token storage**: Simple but creates a bottleneck for validation
   - **In-memory only**: Fast but lacks persistence across restarts
   - **Distributed cache only**: Good performance but adds complexity
   - **Selected approach**: Hybrid approach using JWT for self-validation with a distributed cache (Redis) for revocation checking and opaque token support

3. **Client Management**
   - **Separate system from user management**: Cleaner separation but duplicates functionality
   - **Extend user system to handle machine clients**: Simpler but could confuse user and machine authentication
   - **Selected approach**: Extend the existing API key management system, which already handles non-user credentials

4. **Scope Implementation**
   - **Fixed scope list**: Simple but inflexible
   - **Free-form scopes**: Flexible but harder to validate and document
   - **Resource-based automatic scopes**: Convenient but could lead to overly broad permissions
   - **Selected approach**: Structured, hierarchical scopes with a registry, balancing flexibility and control

5. **Key Management**
   - **Static signing keys**: Simple but less secure
   - **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**: Maximum security but complex and expensive
   - **Manual key rotation**: More control but operational overhead
   - **Selected approach**: Automated key rotation with multiple active keys to enable seamless rotation

### Open Issues

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - What is the expected peak volume of token requests per second?
   - Are there specific latency requirements for token validation?
   - How will the system handle bursts of authentication requests?

2. **Integration Points**
   - How will the M2M authentication system integrate with the existing API key management?
   - What modifications are needed to the current database schema?
   - Are there specific MCP server requirements for token validation?

3. **Security Requirements**
   - What level of security audit is required before deployment?
   - Are there specific compliance requirements for credential handling?
   - What is the threat model for machine client authentication in the MCP ecosystem?

4. **Operational Considerations**
   - What monitoring and alerting are required for the M2M authentication system?
   - How will client credential rotation be managed operationally?
   - What disaster recovery requirements exist for the authentication system?

5. **Scope Management**
   - What specific scopes will be required for the MCP ecosystem?
   - Who will manage the scope registry and approval process?
   - How granular should resource permissions be defined?

6. **Client SDK Development**
   - Which programming languages should be prioritized for SDK development?
   - What level of abstraction should the SDKs provide?
   - How will SDK versioning align with the authorization server versioning?
