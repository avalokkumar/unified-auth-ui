# Capability: OAuth 2.1 Compliant Authorization Server for MCP Ecosystem

## Context
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem requires a standardized, secure approach to authentication and authorization. Currently, the Unified Authentication UI provides basic authentication services but lacks the specialized OAuth 2.1 implementation required for the MCP ecosystem. OAuth 2.1 consolidates security best practices from OAuth 2.0 extensions and offers enhanced security through mandatory PKCE, removal of insecure flows, and improved token handling.

## Rationale
Implementing an OAuth 2.1 compliant authorization server is critical for several reasons:
- Enables secure access to MCP servers with standardized protocols
- Provides a single trusted authority for authentication across the ecosystem
- Addresses the unique authentication needs of different entity types (humans, services, AI agents)
- Enforces consistent security policies and monitoring
- Reduces implementation burden for individual MCP server owners
- Enables advanced delegation patterns necessary for AI agent interactions

## Functional Objectives

### Critical / Required
- Implement core OAuth 2.1 endpoints (authorization, token, introspection, revocation)
- Support multiple entity types (human users, M2M services, AI agents)
- Implement required OAuth 2.1 flows (Authorization Code with PKCE, Client Credentials)
- Support JWT and opaque token formats with proper signing and validation
- Implement client registration and management
- Support token lifecycle management (issuance, validation, refresh, revocation)
- Implement secure storage for tokens, client credentials, and user sessions
- Provide developer SDKs for common programming languages

### Optional / Nice to Have
- Implement advanced security features (mTLS, DPoP, token binding)
- Support Dynamic Client Registration for AI agent onboarding
- Implement Token Exchange for delegation scenarios
- Add support for OpenID Connect for SSO capabilities
- Implement advanced monitoring and anomaly detection
- Support custom token claims for MCP-specific attributes
- Add support for fine-grained scopes and permissions
- Implement device authorization grant for IoT devices

## Non-Functional Objectives
- Performance & scalability:
  - Support for 1000+ token requests per second
  - 99.99% uptime SLA for authorization services
  - < 50ms response time for token validation
  - Horizontal scalability for all components
- Reliability / SLOs:
  - Graceful degradation during peak loads
  - Auto-recovery mechanisms for system failures
  - Multi-region failover capabilities
- Authorization & compliance integration:
  - Compliance with GDPR, SOC2, and other relevant standards
  - Support for comprehensive audit logging
  - Adherence to OWASP security best practices
- Quality gates:
  - 95%+ unit test coverage for all authorization components
  - Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
  - Performance testing for scaling validation
- Observability:
  - Comprehensive logging for all authentication events
  - Prometheus metrics for system performance
  - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Documentation deliverables:
  - Developer integration guides
  - SDK documentation
  - Operational runbooks

## Technical Insights
- Stateless architecture for horizontal scalability
- Secure key management for JWT signing
- Database selection for token and client storage
- Caching strategy for token validation
- Proper rate limiting and anti-abuse mechanisms
- Secure communication channels (TLS 1.3+)
- Integration with existing identity providers

## UI & Design Resources
- Admin interface for client management
- Developer portal for API exploration
- Consent screens for authorization flows
- Self-service client registration portal
- Documentation with interactive examples

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Performance bottlenecks during token validation | Implement caching layer and optimize validation logic |
| Key management vulnerabilities | Use secure key management service with proper rotation |
| Token leakage | Implement short lifetimes and token binding technologies |
| Compatibility issues with existing systems | Create comprehensive test suite and migration tools |
| Complex implementation delays | Break down into smaller, independently deployable components |
| Security vulnerabilities | Regular penetration testing and security reviews |

## Prerequisites
- Existing identity management system
- Database for token and client storage
- Key management system for JWT signing
- Caching infrastructure for performance
- API gateway for traffic management
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- All OAuth 2.1 flows successfully implemented and tested
- Security review passed with no critical findings
- Performance requirements met under load testing
- Successful integration with at least 3 MCP server implementations
- Documentation and developer SDKs completed and validated
- Administration interfaces fully functional

## Out of Scope
- Support for deprecated OAuth 2.0 flows (Implicit, Resource Owner Password)
- Social login integration (will be handled separately)
- User management features (will leverage existing systems)
- Complex authorization policies (will be implemented at the resource server level)

## Unresolved Issues
- Should we implement our own authorization server or leverage an existing framework?
- What is the exact performance requirement for peak load scenarios?
- How should we handle transitioning existing authentication methods to OAuth 2.1?
- What specific compliance requirements must be addressed?
- Should we prioritize specific SDK languages for the initial release?

## Documentation Changes
- Update `reference/oauth2.1-implementation.md` with detailed implementation guidelines
- Create `reference/auth-server-architecture.md` for system architecture documentation
- Update `reference/security-best-practices.md` with OAuth 2.1 specific security guidelines

## Reference Materials
- OAuth 2.1 specification: https://oauth.net/2.1/
- MCP Authorization Specification (internal document)
- Spring Authorization Server documentation
- OAuth 2.0 Threat Model (RFC 6819)
- OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice
