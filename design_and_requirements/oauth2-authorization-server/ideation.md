# Ideation — OAuth 2.1 Compliant Authorization Server for MCP Ecosystem

## Cycle 1 — 2025-05-30

### Decisions to Take

1. **Framework Selection**
   - Decision: Leverage an existing OAuth framework as the foundation rather than building from scratch
   - Options to evaluate: Spring Authorization Server, Keycloak, ORY Hydra, Node-OAuthServer
   - Primary criteria: Compliance with OAuth 2.1, extensibility, scalability, and active maintenance

2. **Token Format and Strategy**
   - Decision: Support both JWT and opaque tokens with conditional usage
   - Use JWT tokens for standard scenarios with non-sensitive claims
   - Use opaque tokens for high-security scenarios or when token size is a concern
   - Implement token introspection for all resource servers

3. **Entity-Specific Flow Mapping**
   - Decision: Map specific OAuth 2.1 flows to entity types:
     - Human users: Authorization Code with PKCE + OpenID Connect
     - M2M services: Client Credentials with mTLS option
     - AI agents: Dynamic Client Registration + Token Exchange
     - IoT/devices: Device Authorization Grant

4. **Technical Architecture**
   - Decision: Implement a microservices-based architecture
   - Separate services for:
     - Authorization endpoint
     - Token management
     - Client registration and management
     - Admin interfaces
   - Shared components for:
     - Token validation
     - Cryptographic operations
     - Storage abstraction

5. **Deployment and Scaling Strategy**
   - Decision: Deploy on Kubernetes for container orchestration
   - Use horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU/memory metrics
   - Implement multi-region deployment for high availability
   - Use stateless design with distributed caching (Redis)

### Reasoning / Trade-offs

1. **Build vs. Leverage**
   - Building a custom OAuth 2.1 server would provide maximum control but carries significant risk and development time
   - Leveraging an existing framework reduces time-to-market and security risks
   - Trade-off: Some customization limitations vs. accelerated development
   - Reasoning: The core OAuth 2.1 protocol is well-defined and common across implementations; our differentiation will come from MCP-specific extensions

2. **Monolithic vs. Microservices**
   - Monolithic design would simplify initial development and deployment
   - Microservices offer better scaling, fault isolation, and team autonomy
   - Trade-off: Development complexity vs. operational flexibility
   - Reasoning: Given the expected scale and critical nature of the authorization server, the microservices approach provides necessary flexibility for scaling different components independently

3. **Token Format Considerations**
   - JWTs are self-contained and reduce database lookups but are larger and cannot be revoked without additional mechanisms
   - Opaque tokens require introspection but offer better revocation and size characteristics
   - Trade-off: Performance vs. security and control
   - Reasoning: Supporting both with context-specific usage provides flexibility to optimize for different scenarios

4. **Storage Strategy**
   - In-memory storage offers fastest performance but lacks persistence
   - Relational databases provide ACID guarantees but may limit scaling
   - NoSQL solutions offer horizontal scaling but with potential consistency trade-offs
   - Trade-off: Consistency vs. performance and scale
   - Reasoning: A hybrid approach with Redis for caching and a scalable database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for persistence offers the best balance

5. **Key Management**
   - Using HSM (Hardware Security Module) provides highest security but adds complexity and cost
   - Software-based key management is more flexible but potentially less secure
   - Trade-off: Security vs. operational simplicity and cost
   - Reasoning: Start with a strong software-based solution with regular rotation, with HSM as a future enhancement for high-security environments

### Alternatives Explored

1. **Authentication Approaches**
   - **Custom token system**: Rejected due to lack of standardization and ecosystem support
   - **OpenID Connect only**: Considered but too focused on user authentication, not sufficient for M2M and AI agent scenarios
   - **SAML integration**: Too heavyweight and legacy-oriented for modern API-centric architecture

2. **Architectural Patterns**
   - **Event-driven architecture**: Considered for token events but adds complexity without clear benefits for core authorization flows
   - **Serverless implementation**: Evaluated but token issuance workloads are steady rather than bursty, making containers more cost-effective
   - **Standalone authorization server**: Simpler but would limit scaling capabilities for different components

3. **Token Management**
   - **Token encryption**: Considered but adds unnecessary overhead as transport encryption (TLS) is sufficient for most scenarios
   - **Central token store only**: Would create a single point of failure and scaling bottleneck
   - **Stateless-only tokens**: Would eliminate introspection capability needed for fine-grained control

4. **Client Authentication**
   - **API keys only**: Too simplistic for OAuth 2.1 requirements
   - **Certificate-only authentication**: Too complex for all clients, especially browser-based applications
   - **Custom authentication schemes**: Would reduce interoperability with standard OAuth clients

5. **Language/Framework Choices**
   - **Go-based implementation**: Fast and efficient but smaller ecosystem of OAuth libraries
   - **Pure JavaScript stack**: Good for frontend integration but potential performance limitations at scale
   - **Polyglot implementation**: Allows optimal language per component but increases operational complexity

### Open Issues

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - What are the exact peak loads expected for token issuance and validation?
   - What is the acceptable latency for token validation in high-throughput scenarios?
   - How will performance requirements scale over the next 12-24 months?

2. **Deployment Constraints**
   - Are there specific cloud provider requirements or restrictions?
   - What are the disaster recovery requirements (RPO/RTO)?
   - Are there any data sovereignty or compliance requirements affecting deployment regions?

3. **Integration Requirements**
   - What existing identity providers need integration?
   - Are there specific MCP server implementations that need special consideration?
   - What level of backward compatibility is required with existing authentication systems?

4. **Security Standards**
   - What specific security certifications are required?
   - Are there regulatory requirements affecting token handling or storage?
   - What level of security review and penetration testing is required before production?

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Which programming languages should be prioritized for SDK development?
   - What level of documentation detail is required for different audience types?
   - How will the developer experience be tested and validated?

6. **Operational Requirements**
   - What level of observability is required for the authorization server?
   - What are the SLA requirements for different components?
   - What is the expected time frame for implementing advanced security features?
