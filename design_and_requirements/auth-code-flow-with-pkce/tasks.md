# Capability: Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for Human Users

## Context
The Unified Authentication UI currently provides basic authentication services but needs to be enhanced with OAuth 2.1 compliant flows to support the MCP ecosystem. The Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is the recommended OAuth 2.1 flow for applications where a human user is involved. It protects against authorization code interception attacks and is mandatory in OAuth 2.1, replacing the less secure implicit flow.

## Rationale
Implementing the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for human users is essential for several reasons:
- Provides a secure authentication mechanism for web, mobile, and native applications
- Protects against authorization code interception attacks, a common vulnerability in OAuth implementations
- Complies with OAuth 2.1 standards which mandate PKCE for all authorization code flows
- Enables separation of authentication concerns from MCP server business logic
- Supports a wide range of client application types (browser-based SPAs, mobile apps, traditional web apps)
- Improves user experience by enabling single sign-on across the MCP ecosystem

## Functional Objectives

### Critical / Required
- Implement authorization endpoint with PKCE validation
- Support dynamic client registration for public clients
- Implement token endpoint with authorization code exchange
- Create user authentication and consent screens
- Support refresh token issuance and validation
- Implement proper error handling for all authentication scenarios
- Support multiple redirect URI validation with exact matching
- Enable state parameter for CSRF protection
- Implement proper scope validation and user consent
- Support standard OAuth 2.1 error codes and responses
- Create session management capabilities

### Optional / Nice to Have
- Implement OpenID Connect on top of Authorization Code Flow
- Support customizable consent screens per client application
- Implement remember consent functionality for repeat authorizations
- Add support for custom claims in tokens
- Enable login hint parameter for improved UX
- Implement step-up authentication for sensitive operations
- Support CORS for cross-origin token requests
- Add device binding for enhanced security
- Implement progressive authorization for incremental scope granting
- Support for custom authorization policies

## Non-Functional Objectives
- Performance & scalability:
  - Support for 100+ authorization requests per second
  - < 500ms response time for the complete authorization flow
  - Ability to scale authorization endpoint independently
- Reliability / SLOs:
  - 99.99% uptime for authorization endpoint
  - Graceful handling of backend service failures
  - Proper session persistence across authorization server instances
- Authorization & compliance integration:
  - Compliance with OAuth 2.1 specifications
  - Support for audit logging of all authorization events
  - Privacy by design with minimal data collection
- Quality gates:
  - Comprehensive test suite covering all flow variations
  - Security review of implementation
  - Performance testing under load
- Observability:
  - Detailed logging of authorization flow steps
  - Metrics for authorization successes and failures
  - Tracing of authorization requests through the system
- Documentation deliverables:
  - Client integration guide for all application types
  - API reference documentation
  - Flow diagrams and sequence charts

## Technical Insights
- The authorization code should be short-lived (60 seconds maximum)
- PKCE challenge method should support both plain and S256 (with S256 preferred)
- Secure storage for authorization codes and PKCE verifiers
- Proper TLS implementation for all endpoints
- Stateless design where possible for horizontal scaling
- Proper session management with secure cookies
- CSRF protection for all browser-based flows
- XSS protection in all web interfaces
- Proper handling of mobile app redirect mechanisms

## UI & Design Resources
- Login screen with username/password or other authentication methods
- Consent screen showing requested scopes and app information
- Error screens for various authentication failures
- Success redirect handling
- Loading states during authentication
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Accessibility compliance for all screens
- Multi-language support for authentication interfaces

## Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| PKCE implementation flaws | Follow OAuth 2.1 specs precisely, thorough security review |
| Code interception vulnerabilities | Short code lifetimes, one-time use, PKCE validation |
| Phishing through malicious clients | Proper client validation, clear consent screens |
| Session fixation attacks | Generate new session IDs after authentication |
| Consent screen bypass | Server-side enforcement of consent |
| CSRF attacks | Implement and validate state parameter |
| Open redirector vulnerabilities | Strict redirect URI validation |
| Performance bottlenecks | Optimize database queries, implement caching |

## Prerequisites
- Existing user authentication system
- Client registration and management system
- Token generation and validation components
- Session management system
- Database for authorization code storage
- Frontend framework for consent screens
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- Authorization Code Flow with PKCE successfully handles all standard use cases
- Security review finds no critical vulnerabilities
- All error scenarios are properly handled with appropriate error messages
- Flow supports both public and confidential clients
- Consent screen properly displays client and scope information
- Authorization codes are properly validated and can only be used once
- PKCE validation correctly prevents code interception attacks
- Performance meets or exceeds requirements under load
- Integration tests pass for all supported client types

## Out of Scope
- Support for Implicit Flow (explicitly deprecated in OAuth 2.1)
- Support for Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
- Social login integration (will be handled separately)
- Complex authorization policies (will be implemented at resource server level)
- User registration functionality (leverages existing system)

## Unresolved Issues
- What authentication methods should be supported for the initial user login?
- How should scope descriptions be managed and displayed on the consent screen?
- What is the expected volume of authorization requests during peak hours?
- Should we implement custom consent handling for different client types?
- How granular should the permission scopes be for MCP resources?
